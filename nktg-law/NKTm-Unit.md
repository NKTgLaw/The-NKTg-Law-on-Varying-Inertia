## Abstract

The **NKTg Law (Law of Varying Inertia)** introduces a new physical quantity: **varying inertia**, reflecting the interaction between position, velocity, and mass.  

To measure this, a new unit called **NKTm** is established. NKTm has been verified using NASA JPL Horizons data (Neptune, 2023–2024), and shown to be **independent of Newton, Joule, and Watt**.

## 1. Theoretical Basis

The NKTg Law describes motion as:

\[
NKTg = f(x, v, m)
\]

where:  
- *x*: position [L]  
- *v*: velocity [L/T]  
- *m*: mass [M]  
- *p = m·v*: momentum [M·L/T]  

Two expressions define varying inertia:  

- **NKTg₁ = x · p** (Position–Momentum interaction)  
- **NKTg₂ = (dm/dt) · p** (Mass-variation–Momentum interaction)  

Both are measured in the new unit: **NKTm**.

## 2. Dimensional Analysis

- From **NKTg₁**: [M·L²/T]  
- From **NKTg₂**: [M²·L/T²]  

Comparison with classical units:

| Quantity  | Unit  | Dimension   |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Force     | N     | [M·L/T²]    |
| Energy    | J     | [M·L²/T²]   |
| Power     | W     | [M·L²/T³]   |
| NKTm₁     | NKTm  | [M·L²/T]    |
| NKTm₂     | NKTm  | [M²·L/T²]   |

Thus, NKTm is unique and independent from Newton, Joule, Watt.

## 3. Verification with NASA Data (Neptune 2023–2024)

- Position (*x*): 4.498 × 10⁹ km  
- Velocity (*v*): 5.43 km/s  
- Mass (*m*): 1.0243 × 10²⁶ kg  
- Momentum (*p* = m·v): 5.564 × 10²⁶ kg·m/s  

Results:  
- **NKTg₁ = x·p ≈ 2.503 × 10³⁶ NKTm**  
- **NKTg₂ ≈ -1.113 × 10²² NKTm** (assumed micro gas escape)  
- **Total NKTg ≈ 2.501 × 10³⁶ NKTm**

## 4. Applications

- **Astronomy**: planetary mass variation, stellar evolution, orbital stability  
- **Aerospace**: rocket trajectory optimization, ion/plasma engines, mass leakage effects  
- **Earth sciences**: GRACE-FO data, ice melting, sea-level rise, mass redistribution  
- **Engineering**: robotics with variable load, cargo systems, nonlinear vibrations

## 5. Significance

- Establishes **NKTm** as a fundamental measurement unit, independent of Newton/Joule/Watt.  
- Provides a new **framework for variable-mass systems**, beyond Newton and Einstein.  
- Bridges **theory and computation**, enabling accurate simulation in variable-mass environments.

## Conclusion

The introduction of the **NKTm unit** shows that varying inertia is a measurable, independent physical quantity.  

Just as Newton measures force and Joule measures energy, NKTm provides the measurement foundation for the **NKTg Law**, opening a new perspective in both theoretical physics and practical applications.
