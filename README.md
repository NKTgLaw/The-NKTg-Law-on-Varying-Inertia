# The NKTg Law on Varying Inertia

A novel formulation of orbital dynamics that describes how an object's motion in space depends on its **position**, **velocity**, and **mass** — through a new quantity called **NKTg**.

## 📌 Overview

The **NKTg Law** proposes a relationship that governs an object's movement tendency based on three parameters:

NKTg = f(x, v, m)

Where:
- `x`: Position or displacement of the object relative to a reference point.
- `v`: Velocity of the object.
- `m`: Mass of the object.

The law defines two core components of varying inertia:

### 🔸 Component 1: Position-Momentum Interaction

NKTg₁ = x × p

Where `p = m × v` is the linear momentum.  
`NKTg₁` reflects the interaction between position and momentum.

- If `NKTg₁ > 0`: The object tends to move **away** from its stable state.
- If `NKTg₁ < 0`: The object tends to return **toward** its stable state.

### 🔸 Component 2: Mass Variation Effect

NKTg₂ = (dm/dt) × p

Where:
- `dm/dt` is the **rate of mass change over time**.
- `NKTg₂` measures how mass variation influences movement.

- If `NKTg₂ > 0`: Mass change **supports** the movement.
- If `NKTg₂ < 0`: Mass change **resists** the movement.

> 📏 Unit: Both components are expressed in **NKTm**, a proposed unit representing "varying inertia".

## 🔧 Stable State Definition

A **stable state** is defined as a configuration where position (`x`), velocity (`v`), and mass (`m`) interact to preserve the object's current motion without deviation or loss of control. In such a state, the object maintains its natural orbital or inertial behavior.

## 📂 Applications

This theoretical framework can be applied to:
- Predicting orbital behavior of satellites and planets
- Reinterpreting spacecraft trajectory dynamics
- Revisiting principles of momentum in variable-mass systems
